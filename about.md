## Whoami

I'm interested in anything to do with cybersecurity. I'm currently employed as a cyber defense operator (sounds cool, but not really). Anyway, I'll edit this later when I come up with something better.  

### Things I want to do (In no particular order)

1. Python
2. PowerShell
3. Learn more about PCAP Analysis
4. Tackle a new certification
5. Learn more about hardware stuff, like soldering, SAOs, stuff like that.
6. Attend more conferences
7. Participate in more CTFs
