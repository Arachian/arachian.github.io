## Whoami

I'm interested in anything to do with cybersecurity. I'm currently employed as a cyber defense operator (sounds cool, but not really). Anyway, I'll edit this later when I come up with something better.  

### Things I want to do (in no particular order)

1. Become proficient using Python
2. Become proficient using PowerShell
3. Learn more about PCAP Analysis
4. Obtain a new certification
5. Learn more about hardware stuff (soldering, SAOs, etc)
6. Attend more conferences
7. Participate in more CTFs
